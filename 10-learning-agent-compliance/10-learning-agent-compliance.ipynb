    "## Creating the Learning Compliance Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll create our **Learning Agent [Compliance]** using the `ChatCompletionAgent` class. This agent embodies the role of a proactive compliance manager that can operate autonomously while providing human administrators with powerful tools and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Personality and Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Learning Compliance Agent is designed with specific characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proactive**: Identifies issues before they become critical\n",
    "- **Professional**: Maintains appropriate tone for workplace communications\n",
    "- **Empathetic**: Understands that employees have varying schedules and constraints\n",
    "- **Data-Driven**: Makes decisions based on actual compliance data and deadlines\n",
    "- **Actionable**: Always provides clear next steps and recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Instruction Patterns for Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent's instructions demonstrate several important patterns for system-triggered agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role Clarity**: \"You are a Learning Compliance Manager AI Agent\"\n",
    "2. **Operational Guidelines**: When to escalate, how to prioritize, communication standards\n",
    "3. **Data Interpretation**: How to analyze compliance reports and identify risks\n",
    "4. **Communication Standards**: Tone, urgency levels, and personalization approaches\n",
    "5. **Automation Logic**: When to trigger reminders, how to handle bulk operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### System-Triggered vs User-Initiated\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike conversational agents, our Learning Compliance Agent is designed to:\n",
    "- Operate on schedules and triggers (daily compliance checks)\n",
    "- Take autonomous actions (sending reminders)\n",
    "- Generate reports proactively (weekly department summaries)\n",
    "- Escalate issues when thresholds are met (overdue mandatory training)\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Pro Tip**: System-triggered agents require more detailed instructions about decision-making criteria and escalation procedures since they operate with less human oversight."
