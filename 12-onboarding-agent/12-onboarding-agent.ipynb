    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Onboarding Agent Architecture** - How to structure an agent that manages complex onboarding workflows\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Task Management\n",
    "- **Paperwork Tasks**: Legal documents, benefits enrollment, tax forms\n",
    "- **Training Tasks**: Mandatory training modules, role-specific learning\n",
    "- **Content Tasks**: Company culture, team introductions, resource familiarization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Document and Reference Management\n",
    "- Company handbook and policies\n",
    "- Role-specific resources and documentation\n",
    "- Team contact information and organizational charts\n",
    "- Learning materials and training content\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Progress Tracking\n",
    "- Completion status of various onboarding phases\n",
    "- Upcoming deadlines and priorities\n",
    "- Personalized recommendations based on role and department\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plugin Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Our plugin demonstrates several best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured Data**: Tasks are organized into clear categories and phases\n",
    "- **Role-Based Customization**: Different content for different positions\n",
    "- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is presented in digestible chunks\n",
    "- **Contextual Help**: Responses adapt to where the employee is in their journey\n",
    "- **Action-Oriented**: Every interaction guides the employee toward next steps"

    "\n",
    "Just like in our other workshops, we need to establish a connection to Azure OpenAI. The onboarding agent uses the same robust, enterprise-grade AI service to provide intelligent, contextual responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration for Onboarding Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "Our onboarding agent will use these AI capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Understanding** - Interprets employee questions about policies, procedures, and company culture\n",
    "- **Task Prioritization** - Helps employees understand what to focus on first based on their role and timeline\n",
    "- **Contextual Responses** - Provides relevant information based on the employee's current onboarding phase\n",
    "- **Conversational Memory** - Remembers previous interactions to provide continuity across onboarding sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "For onboarding systems handling sensitive employee data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure Credential Management** - Never hard-code API keys or sensitive information\n",
    "- **Environment Variables** - Store credentials securely in environment variables or key vaults\n",
    "- **Azure AD Integration** - Use Azure AD for enterprise authentication when possible\n",
    "- **Principle of Least Privilege** - Grant only the minimum permissions necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Production Tip**: In a real onboarding system, you'd integrate with HR systems like Workday, BambooHR, or ADP to pull actual employee data and task status."
