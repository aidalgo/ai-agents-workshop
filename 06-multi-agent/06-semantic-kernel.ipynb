    "## Understanding the Multi-Agent Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This system demonstrates several advanced concepts in multi-agent AI systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Agent Roles and Specialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Front Desk Agent**: \n",
    "   - Specializes in providing travel recommendations\n",
    "   - Designed to be brief and focused on practical suggestions\n",
    "   - Responds to user requests and feedback from the Concierge\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concierge Agent**: \n",
    "   - Acts as a quality reviewer focused on authentic, local experiences\n",
    "   - Evaluates recommendations for their non-touristy value\n",
    "   - Provides feedback to improve suggestions or approves final recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conversation Management Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection Strategy (`KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy`)**:\n",
    "   - Determines which agent speaks next based on conversation context\n",
    "   - Ensures proper turn-taking between agents\n",
    "   - Prevents agents from dominating the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Termination Strategy (`KernelFunctionTerminationStrategy`)**:\n",
    "   - Monitors the conversation for completion conditions\n",
    "   - Ends the conversation when the Concierge approves a recommendation\n",
    "   - Includes safety limits (maximum iterations) to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Benefits of This Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent has a focused role and expertise\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: The review process ensures better recommendations\n",
    "- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Agents collaborate like human experts would\n",
    "- **Flexible and Extensible**: Easy to add new agents or modify behaviors"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "## Expected Conversation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the system, you should see a conversation pattern like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# User: 'I would like to go to Paris.'\n",
    "# Agent - FrontDesk: 'I recommend visiting the Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen, Paris's famous flea market...'\n",
    "# Agent - Concierge: 'This recommendation shows good local insight, but could be refined...'\n",
    "# Agent - FrontDesk: 'Consider exploring the covered passages like Galerie Vivienne...'\n",
    "# Agent - Concierge: 'This recommendation is approved. The covered passages offer authentic Parisian experiences...'\n",
    "# IS COMPLETE: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What to Observe:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Turn-taking**: Agents alternate speaking based on the selection strategy\n",
    "2. **Refinement Process**: The Concierge provides feedback to improve recommendations\n",
    "3. **Completion**: The conversation ends when the Concierge approves a suggestion\n",
    "4. **Quality Focus**: Both agents work toward authentic, non-touristy experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conversation Length:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimum 4 turns to ensure proper collaboration\n",
    "- Maximum 10 iterations to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "- Natural completion when approval is given"

    "## Customization Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend this multi-agent system in various ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Add More Agents**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Add a Budget Advisor agent\n",
    "BUDGET_NAME = \"BudgetAdvisor\"\n",
    "BUDGET_INSTRUCTIONS = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are a budget-conscious travel advisor who evaluates recommendations for cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "Provide feedback on whether recommendations are worth the cost and suggest budget alternatives.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modify Agent Personalities**\n",
    "- Change the Front Desk agent to be more detailed or casual\n",
    "- Make the Concierge focus on different aspects (budget, safety, adventure level)\n",
    "- Add cultural expertise or language considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Adjust Conversation Rules**\n",
    "- Change the minimum/maximum conversation length\n",
    "- Modify termination conditions (e.g., require multiple approvals)\n",
    "- Add new selection patterns (round-robin, expertise-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Domain Adaptation**\n",
    "This pattern works for many collaborative scenarios:\n",
    "- **Code Review**: Developer + Senior Developer + Security Expert\n",
    "- **Content Creation**: Writer + Editor + Subject Matter Expert  \n",
    "- **Product Planning**: Product Manager + Engineer + Designer\n",
    "- **Medical Consultation**: General Practitioner + Specialist + Pharmacist\n",

    "Try adapting the agents and instructions for different domains!"
