    "| Pattern | Best For | Coordination Style | Output Type |\n",
    "|---------|----------|-------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Sequential** | Pipelines, step-by-step processing | Linear flow | Single refined result |\n",
    "| **Concurrent** | Multiple perspectives, brainstorming | Parallel execution | Multiple diverse results |\n",

    "## Key Benefits of Multi-Agent Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on their area of expertise\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents or modify workflows\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Different patterns for different use cases\n",
    "4. **Robustness**: Multiple agents provide redundancy and error checking\n",
    "5. **Unified Interface**: Same API across all orchestration patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential**: When each step depends on the previous one\n",
    "- **Concurrent**: When you need diverse perspectives or quick parallel processing\n",
    "- **Group Chat**: When collaborative discussion adds value\n",
    "- **Handoff**: When different expertise is needed based on context\n",
    "- **Magentic**: When the task is complex and requires adaptive coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment with different patterns for your use cases\n",
    "2. Customize agent instructions for your domain\n",
    "3. Implement error handling and retry logic\n",
    "4. Monitor and optimize agent performance\n",
    "5. Consider hybrid approaches combining multiple patterns\n",
