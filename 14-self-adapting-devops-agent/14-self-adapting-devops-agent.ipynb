    "## Key Differences from Predetermined Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "This self-adapting agent demonstrates several improvements over traditional predetermined remediation scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Dynamic Assessment**\n",
    "- Always checks current system state before taking action\n",
    "- Adapts strategy based on real-time conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Result-Driven Decision Making**\n",
    "- Verifies the outcome of each action\n",
    "- Adjusts next steps based on success/failure\n",
    "- Avoids continuing with a failed strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Intelligent Failure Handling**\n",
    "- When restart fails due to memory issues, tries resource scaling\n",
    "- Considers alternative approaches when initial strategy fails\n",
    "- Learns from action history to avoid repeating failed attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Dependency Awareness**\n",
    "- Understands relationships between pods, services, and volumes\n",
    "- Considers cascade effects of recovery actions\n",
    "- Verifies dependent services after fixing underlying components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Progressive Escalation**\n",
    "- Starts with least disruptive actions (resource scaling)\n",
    "- Escalates to more disruptive actions (restarts, volume recreation) only when needed\n",
    "- Maintains system stability throughout recovery process"

    "To extend this agent for production use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration with Real Infrastructure APIs** (Kubernetes, Docker, cloud providers)\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Monitoring** (metrics, logs, alerts integration)\n",
    "3. **Learning from Outcomes** (ML-based improvement of recovery strategies)\n",
    "4. **Safety Mechanisms** (approval workflows for destructive actions)\n",
    "5. **Multi-Environment Support** (dev, staging, production with different risk profiles)\n",
