    "# Introduction to Semantic Kernel and Basic Agent Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first hands-on experience with AI agents! In this notebook, you'll learn how to use [Semantic Kernel](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/semantic-kernel), Microsoft's open-source AI orchestration framework, to create intelligent agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What Semantic Kernel is** - An AI framework that helps you integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with your applications\n",
    "2. **Core Components** - Agents, plugins, functions, and how they work together\n",
    "3. **Basic Agent Creation** - How to build a simple AI agent that can interact with users\n",
    "4. **Function Calling** - How agents can use custom tools (plugins) to perform specific tasks\n",

    "- **Memory Management**: Built-in conversation history and context management\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Travel Agent Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a **Travel Agent** - a simple but practical AI agent that can:\n",
    "- Suggest vacation destinations\n",
    "- Provide personalized travel recommendations\n",
    "- Handle follow-up questions and requests\n",
    "- Use custom functions to access destination data\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the fundamental patterns you'll use in more advanced agentic scenarios throughout this workshop."

    "## Import the Required Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start building our agent, we need to import the necessary libraries. Each import serves a specific purpose in our agent architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Python Libraries\n",
    "- `os` - For accessing environment variables (API keys, endpoints)\n",
    "- `json` - For handling JSON data in function calls\n",
    "- `typing.Annotated` - For type hints that improve function descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure Authentication\n",
    "- `azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential` - For Azure AD authentication (optional)\n",
    "- `dotenv.load_dotenv` - For loading environment variables from .env files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook Display\n",
    "- `IPython.display` - For rich HTML output in our notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic Kernel Components\n",
    "- `ChatCompletionAgent` - The main agent class that handles conversations\n",
    "- `ChatHistoryAgentThread` - Manages conversation history and context\n",
    "- `AzureChatCompletion` - Connector for Azure OpenAI services\n",
    "- `FunctionCallContent`, `FunctionResultContent`, `StreamingTextContent` - Content types for handling different response formats\n",

    "## Creating the AI Service Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an AI agent, we first need to establish a connection to a Large Language Model (LLM). In this example, we'll use [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Azure OpenAI?\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure OpenAI provides:\n",
    "- **Enterprise-grade security** - Your data stays within your Azure tenant\n",
    "- **Reliable performance** - SLA-backed service with consistent availability\n",
    "- **Compliance** - Meets enterprise compliance requirements\n",
    "- **Integration** - Seamless integration with other Azure services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AzureChatCompletion` connector requires several parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`deployment_name`** - The name of your model deployment (e.g., \"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
    "- **`endpoint`** - Your Azure OpenAI service endpoint URL\n",
    "- **`api_version`** - The API version to use (we use \"2024-02-01\" for latest features)\n",
    "- **`api_key`** - Your service authentication key\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication Options\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide two authentication methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Key Authentication** (Recommended for development)\n",
    "   - Simple and straightforward\n",
    "   - Uses a service-specific API key\n",
    "   - Good for local development and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure AD Authentication** (Recommended for production)\n",
    "   - Uses your Azure identity\n",
    "   - Follows principle of least privilege\n",
    "   - Better for production environments and CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Store your credentials in environment variables or Azure Key Vault, never hard-code them in your source code!"

    "## Understanding Plugins and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we create our agent, let's understand one of Semantic Kernel's most powerful features: **Plugins**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Plugins?\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins are collections of functions that extend your agent's capabilities. Think of them as \"tools\" that your agent can use to perform specific tasks. Without plugins, AI agents can only generate text. With plugins, they can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call external APIs\n",
    "- Access databases\n",
    "- Perform calculations\n",
    "- Interact with other services\n",
    "- Execute custom business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `@kernel_function` Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@kernel_function` decorator transforms a regular Python method into an agent-callable function. Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auto-discovery**: The agent automatically knows about these functions\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Uses Python type hints for parameter validation\n",
    "- **Documentation**: The `description` parameter helps the agent understand when to call the function\n",
    "- **Return Types**: `Annotated` types provide clear descriptions of what the function returns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Example: DestinationsPlugin\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a simple plugin that provides vacation destinations. This demonstrates:\n",
    "- How to structure a plugin class\n",
    "- How to implement kernel functions\n",
    "- How to manage state within a plugin\n",
    "- How to provide meaningful descriptions for the AI agent"

    "Now we'll create our **Travel Agent** using the `ChatCompletionAgent` class. This is where we bring together all the components: the AI service, the plugins, and the agent's personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Components Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "A Semantic Kernel agent consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Service**: The AI model connection (our Azure OpenAI service)\n",
    "2. **Plugins**: The tools/functions the agent can use\n",
    "3. **Name**: An identifier for the agent (useful in multi-agent scenarios)\n",
    "4. **Instructions**: The agent's \"personality\" and behavioral guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crafting Effective Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `instructions` parameter is crucial - it defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role and Purpose**: What the agent is supposed to do\n",
    "- **Behavior Guidelines**: How it should interact with users\n",
    "- **Decision Logic**: When to use specific functions or approaches\n",
    "- **Conversation Flow**: How to structure interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Instruction Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Travel Agent instructions demonstrate several best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear Role Definition**: \"You are a helpful AI Agent that can help plan vacations\"\n",
    "- **Conditional Logic**: \"When users specify a destination, always plan for that location\"\n",
    "- **Structured Responses**: Providing numbered options and clear guidance\n",
    "- **User Preference Priority**: \"Always prioritize user preferences\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is where the magic happens! We'll execute our agent and observe how it handles conversations, makes decisions, and uses its tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Agent Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Our execution code demonstrates several important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Conversation Threading**\n",
    "- `ChatHistoryAgentThread` maintains conversation context\n",
    "- Each message builds on previous interactions\n",
    "- The agent remembers what was discussed earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Streaming Responses**\n",
    "- `invoke_stream()` provides real-time response streaming\n",
    "- Users see the agent \"thinking\" and responding progressively\n",
    "- Better user experience for longer responses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Function Call Handling**\n",
    "The agent's response can contain different types of content:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`FunctionCallContent`**: When the agent decides to use a plugin function\n",
    "- **`FunctionResultContent`**: The result returned from the function call\n",
    "- **`StreamingTextContent`**: The agent's conversational response text\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Rich Display Format**\n",
    "Our code creates an HTML display that shows:\n",
    "- User inputs clearly marked\n",
    "- Function calls in expandable sections (to reduce clutter)\n",
    "- Agent responses formatted nicely\n",
    "- Clear conversation flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "We've included two test inputs that demonstrate different agent behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Plan me a day trip\"** - Tests the agent's ability to use the random destination function\n",
    "2. **\"I don't like that destination. Plan me another vacation\"** - Tests conversational memory and follow-up handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Watch For\n",
    "\n",
    "As you run this code, observe:\n",
    "- How the agent decides when to call the `get_random_destination` function\n",
    "- How it maintains context between messages\n",
    "- How it handles the user's rejection and provides alternatives\n",
    "- The natural conversation flow despite using structured function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Experiment**: Try modifying the `user_inputs` to test different scenarios and see how the agent responds!"

    "## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've just created your first AI agent using Semantic Kernel! Let's recap what you've accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **AI Service Connection** - Connected to Azure OpenAI with proper authentication  \n",
    "âœ… **Custom Plugin** - Created a `DestinationsPlugin` with a `get_random_destination` function  \n",
    "âœ… **Intelligent Agent** - Built a Travel Agent with specific instructions and behavior  \n",
    "âœ… **Conversation Flow** - Implemented streaming responses with conversation memory  \n",
    "âœ… **Function Integration** - Watched the agent automatically decide when to use tools  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Mastered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Architecture**: Service + Plugins + Instructions = Intelligent Agent\n",
    "2. **Function Calling**: How agents use tools to extend their capabilities\n",
    "3. **Conversation Management**: Maintaining context across multiple interactions\n",
    "4. **Streaming Responses**: Real-time, progressive response generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps in Your AI Agent Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundation prepares you for more advanced patterns in the upcoming notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced Tool Use** - More complex plugins and function orchestration\n",
    "- **Agentic RAG** - Combining retrieval-augmented generation with agents\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Coordinating multiple specialized agents\n",
    "- **Planning & Design** - Agents that can break down complex tasks\n",
    "- **Metacognition** - Self-aware agents that can reflect on their own processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment and Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these modifications to deepen your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add new destinations** to the `destinations` list\n",
    "2. **Create additional functions** in the plugin (e.g., `get_weather_for_destination`)\n",
    "3. **Modify the agent instructions** to change its personality\n",
    "4. **Add new test scenarios** in `user_inputs`\n",
    "5. **Experiment with different models** by changing the deployment name\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready for more advanced agent patterns? Continue to the next notebook! ðŸš€"
