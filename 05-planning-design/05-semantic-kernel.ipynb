    "\n",
    "### 1. **Structured Output with Pydantic**\n",
    "- Using Pydantic models to ensure the agent returns well-formatted, validated data\n",
    "- The `response_format` parameter enforces the agent to follow the defined schema\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Planning and Delegation**\n",
    "- A planning agent that analyzes complex requests and breaks them into manageable subtasks\n",
    "- Each subtask is assigned to a specialized agent based on its capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Agent Specialization**\n",
    "- Different agents handle specific domains (flights, hotels, car rentals, activities, destination info)\n",
    "- This modular approach allows for better expertise and easier maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Validation and Error Handling**\n",
    "- The code includes proper validation to ensure the agent's response matches expected format\n",
    "- Error handling provides debugging information when validation fails\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly useful for complex workflows that require coordination between multiple specialized systems or agents."
